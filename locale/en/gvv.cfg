[gvv-mod-help-control_lua]
1=Editing control.lua
2=To allow [color=yellow]gvv[/color] to access [color=yellow]global[/color] table of mod, savefile or scenario(start from beginning), you need to modify "control.lua" file of demand mod or map.
3=Input following code at first line or last line of "control.lua" file of the mod or map. Or you can modify it to be placed anywhere by assigning it to a "local" value without "()" brackets meaning "execute this function now", then it will be stored function and you can run it anytime later you want.
4=In case of savefile, extract "control.lua" from it first. Then, edit code and overwrite it at same location of "control.lua" inside of the zipped file.
5=Refer __1__ to make [color=yellow]gvv[/color] to access current map temporarily without editing "control.lua".
6=Temporarily available state is not able to be saved. In case of multiplay, extra player joined multiplay in such state can be kicked by desync.

5=__1__ : For tracking [color=blue]LuaObject[/color] starting with "[color=blue]Lua...[/color]" found in [color=yellow]global[/color] table, it is registered here first and its contents can be accessed.
6=__1__ : Access global [color=blue]LuaObject[/color] of Factorio.
7=__1__ : This tab.

[gvv-mod-help-troubleshoot]
1=Troubleshooting
2=Is error message exposed? Most of error occur when the object being tracked actually disappeared or a table among the tracking path is removed.
3=Is this very common thing, and most of case it is resolved by trying to refresh again or seeing and handling what has changed.
4=But can't you access a whole [color=yellow]global[/color] table? This is very special case. If you got error messages similar to following, try following way.
5=Input the name of mod in trouble, and clicking __1__ or __2__ will store the result under [color=yellow]__3__[/color] path of [color=yellow]gvv[/color].
6=Pressing __1__ will actually remove the entries in [color=yellow]global[/color] causing trouble.
7=Entries potentially problematic but not causing trouble now will not be removed by __1__. Only entries in [color=yellow]__2__[/color] are represented as deleted.
8=Clear [color=yellow]__1__[/color] :
